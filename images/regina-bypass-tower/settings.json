  "description": "- [2025-May-08] It looks like this camera goes down every so often and is replaced with a white error message screen 'No live camera feed at this time'. Example: 20250504_2350, 20250508_0815. Because the size of the error message does not include the sky. These images are not processed. They will show as green in the daily charts."
