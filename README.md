# Skypixels Webcam

This script takes a still image from a series of webcam from around the world. Then processes the images and finds the average color of the sky and logs the RGB values to a file.

The <a href='https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/funvill/skypixel/blob/main/index.html'>index.html</a> shows the color for each image.

## Notes

- The list of YouTube streams is from searching for "live" "webcam" and "Vancouver" and "Canada" in YouTube. Then searching though the list to see ones that showed parts of the sky.
- The images taken from the YouTube streams are then stored in a folder. A settings file was manually generated that clipped the sky portion of the images.
